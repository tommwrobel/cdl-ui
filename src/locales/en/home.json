    "TEXT_1_1": "Bismuth is an open-source protocol and a platform, created in the world’s most popular and fastest growing programming language - Python (approx. 10M programmers - potential base of Bismuth blockchain apps creators).",
    "TEXT_1_2": "It allows for the integration of different Python-based projects like applications and games with the blockchain.",
    "TEXT_2_1": "It is a hidden gem and its value is not fully discovered yet (market cap is close to 1/100,000 of ETH, 800k usd market cap - April 2024).",
    "TEXT_2_2": "Projects with their own blockchain, once noticed by the market and supported by enough users, can skyrocket. Solana is a great example where the price jumped from $0.5 to $259 in just over a year.",
    "TEXT_3_1": "Bismuth provides its holder with a very simple way to generate passive income. There is a staking option similar to ETHv2. You keep the funds in your wallet and you can withdraw them anytime.",
    "TEXT_3_2": "Moreover, as there are two separate chains (PoW and PoS) - Bismuth is not vulnerable to 51% attack. Current staking rate of return is approximately 20%."

Cryptocurrencies are complex instruments and carry a high risk of monetary loss. It is important to carefully consider whether you comprehend how cryptocurrencies operate and if you can afford the high risk of losing your money.",

    "TITLE": "GENERAL INFORMATION",
    "TEXT_1": "In the case of Bismuth, we are currently planning a wide range of activities. You can find current information about these activities on our X (Twitter). As we believe that real technology and consequently utility are fundamental for projects aiming for long-term success in the market, we are focusing on developing cooperation with Python developers who would like to use Bismuth technology to integrate their projects with the blockchain. Therefore, if you are a Python developer, please send us information about the project you would like to integrate with the blockchain, and we will not only help but also provide a free starter package of BIS coins for the best projects that you can use within your ecosystem.",
    "TEXT_2": "Bismuth is safe. It supports multiple cryptographic schemes, signing methods, and address formats to protect users from potential future quantum computing attacks. The mix includes RSA, ECDSA (SECP256k1), and ED25519.",
    "TEXT_3": "We also understand that for most investors, the price growth of the coin matters. When we start our promotion of Bismuth, the price fluctuates around 2-3 cents per unit (end of April 2024). This gives a market cap BELOW 1M USD! We don't think we need to explain to anyone what the growth potential is for such an advanced project with such a low starting market cap.",

        "TEXT_1": "On top of its own value Bismuth provides its holder with a very simple way to generate passive income. Through staking the coin on the network computation nodes called Hypernodes, you get the reward which depends on the number of nodes and state of the network (it currently oscillates around 20%).",
        "TEXT_2": "The project offers a great flexibility in this matter as it allows you to create three sizes of Hypernodes: <strong>big (30k), medium (20k) and small (10k)</strong>.",
        "TEXT_3": "There is no requirement to send your staking collateral to the specific Bismuth contract or any other address. Hypernode stakers are in full control of their own stake and can deactivate their hypernode at any point in time. Additionally, there is no incentive for malicious users to attack the hypernode chain as all the stakers possess their private keys and the hypernode chain doesn’t affect the main chain (Proof-of-Work) in its functionality when attacked."
